This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Some important assumptions/design decisions

1. I have considered Wizrd as non-contexual/dumb component based on this assumption i have extracted all application related logic in seperate folder. we can easily share core/component folder to any other project to share the effort

2. I have used Composition pattern in Wizard component to compose Steps component

3. I want to try differnt other solutions but because of time consideration i was not able to implement those. some of the changes i wanted to implement in this application are
   a. More responsive UI
   b. Test coverage

4. This is the first time i have used React as choice for development, so i have taken good references and code snippets from web to create this application
